ITT: /b/ dragon slayer raid!

Rules:
This huge motherfucking dragon appears out of nowhere.
This thread last 2 digits x200 define its HP

Your last 2 digits represent the damage you do
If Roll ends in 5 or 0 you do DOUBLE DAMAGE
If you roll under 11 you DIE! (your posts will no longer do damage)
If you roll 00 you REVIVE everyone! their damage will count again!

I have the webpage to track things, I will post a link to it here.
