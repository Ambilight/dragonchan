ITT: /b/ dragon slayer raid!

Rules:
This huge motherfucking dragon appears out of nowhere.
This thread last 2 digits x250 define its HP

If your ID starts with a number you are a HEALER.
otherwise you are a KNIGHT
Your last 2 digits represent the damage you do
if KNIGHT Roll ends in 5 or 0 you do DOUBLE DAMAGE
If you roll under 11 you DIE! (your posts will no longer do damage)
The dragon heals a small amount every time he kills someone
HEALERS can revive fallen soldiers by targeting them and rolling an EVEN number
KNIGHTS can avenge fallen soldiers by targeting them and rolling an EVEN number
you can be avenged/revived 3 times max
If you roll 00 or 69 you REVIVE everyone! their damage will count again!
The boss will enrage bellow 20% HP, the minimum roll will be 22. however, he will no longer heal himself

I have a webpage to track things, I will post a link to it here.
